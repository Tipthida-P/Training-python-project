Pythonâ€™s set class represents the mathematical notion of a set.\n","\n","**Dictionary**: in Python is an ordered (since Py 3.7) [unordered (Py 3.6 & prior)] collection of data values, used to store data values like a map, which, unlike other Data Types that hold only a single value as an element, Dictionary holds key:value pair. Key-value is provided in the dictionary to make it more optimized.\n","\n","\n","reference : https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/differences-and-applications-of-list-tuple-set-and-dictionary-in-python/"],"metadata":{"id":"UjrGDbD-M4bB"}},{"cell_type":"code","source":["## Example 02 ##\n","\n","list1=[1,4,\"Gitam\",6,\"college\"]\n","list2=[]  #
